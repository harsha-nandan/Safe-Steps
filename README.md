# SafeSteps 🚨 — Women Safety Wearable Prototype (ESP32 + BLE)

SafeSteps is a women’s safety wearable prototype designed to enable quick emergency assistance using a lightweight IoT setup. The project focuses on building a low-cost, simple, and reliable wearable that can work in real-world situations where reacting fast matters.

---

## 🎯 Goal
Build a wearable-based safety prototype that can trigger rapid alert workflows and enable proximity/detection-based safety actions using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).

---

## ✅ Key Features
- Wearable safety device prototype
- BLE-based communication and detection workflow
- Emergency alert triggering logic (prototype stage)
- Designed for fast response + simplicity
- Built with a real hardware prototype and demo media

---

## 🧩 System Overview (High-Level)
**Device Layer**
- ESP32-C3 Super Mini as the core controller
- BLE used for wireless communication/detection
- Alert workflow handled on the device side (prototype logic)

**Prototype Workflow**
1. Device powers on and initializes BLE
2. BLE-based detection / event trigger occurs
3. Device executes alert workflow (prototype-level)
4. Designed to be extended into mobile/cloud logging later
